This directory *standalone simulation codes* contains the main programming codes for the numerical studies of the article
"Efficient Estimation of the Maximal Association between Multiple Predictors and a Survival Outcome" that is authored by Tzu-Jung Huang, Alex Luedtke and Ian W. McKeague
and accepted by Annals of Statistics.

In this directory, the script *example_sim_maxCorrSurv.R* demonstrates how to use our codes to generate the p-values and CIs of our proposed approach Stabilized One-Step Estimator ('SOSE')
and its competing methods (as mentioned in Competing Methods Section of the article) in a standalone-computer-manageable scenario. Running this script also needs auxiliary functions
collected in the files *code_maxCorrSurv.R*, *data_management.R* and *sim_data_acquisition.R* in the same directory.
